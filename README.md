## Problem Synopsis
"There is a couple consisting of two individuals, A and B. Both 25 years old now and they aim to retire at 67, possibly deferred to 70. A down payment for $275,000 is also expected in 10 years.
<br><br>
The initial salary of A is $125,000, which he anticipates will grow at the rate 10% per year for the first 10 years and the inflation rate thereafter. B expects to start working at age 30 with an initial salary of $250,000 per year and grows at the inflation rate thereafter. We still assume that the inflation rate is normally distributed with average of 2.2% and standard deviation of 0.3%. Propose a retirement plan for B considering her fi-nancial situation. Recommend the best strategy (clearly define what does the ”best” strategy means) in your opinion, together with the appropriate savings amount (as a percentage of salary) and the comfortable annual spending amount after retirement (likely 60%-80% of the final salary).
<br><br>
Next, consider two goals together. They want to make condo down payment in 10 years and save for their retirement. Propose a plan to integrate these two goals and show how shifting savings from one side to the other affects their ability to reach their goals. Use the tools you have learned from the course, write a full recommendation report to individuals as if you are an investment planning specialist. Please use the same dataset from the previous homework and think about the ways to make simulation scheme more robust. You can use the portfolio weights from the previous homework or can suggest a new strategy."
